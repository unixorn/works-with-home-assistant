# Description

<!---
Notes suggestions:

- It is ok to add a link to a device that doesn't work - just add it in the non-working devices section to warn off other users from buying it.
- If the device you're adding in your PR won't work in a local-only mode, please say so in the **Notes** column of your entry.
- If it requires a remote service, definitely note that - I prefer to not buy anything that will brick if the vendor goes out of business or decides to cancel the product line, or even if your internet is just having an outage.
- If it tries to phone home - note that too.
- If you have to reflash a device to get it working with Home Assistant, please add that to the **Notes** column. Ideally add a link to the reflash instructions for the device
- If you need to add a plugin to Home Assistant before it can be used, add that to **Notes** too.
- If it requires the devices connect to an internet server, even just for initial configuration, please add that to **Notes** - I want it easy to see which devices won't brick if the vendor goes out of business and also aren't vulnerable to some jackass hacking the company's servers.
